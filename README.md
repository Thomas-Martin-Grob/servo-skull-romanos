# Servo Skull Romanos
Repository for auto-compiling Orthodox services.

The first aim is to automatically compile all the necessary texts for Sunday vespers and matins, based on available Orthodox service books, such as Horologion, Octoechos, Menaion, Lenten Triodion, Pentecostarion, and so on.
The script automatically calculates the date for the next Sunday and the tone of the week.

The project is still in its infancy and not ready for widespread release!
